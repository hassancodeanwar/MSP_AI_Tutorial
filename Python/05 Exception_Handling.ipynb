    "### 21. Handling Errors with `try` and `except`\n",
    "\n",
    "Exception handling in Python allows you to gracefully handle errors or exceptions that may occur during the execution of your code. It prevents your program from crashing when unexpected issues arise.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `try` and `except` Blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "Use `try` and `except` blocks to handle exceptions. Code inside the `try` block is monitored for exceptions. If an exception occurs, Python jumps to the corresponding `except` block and executes the code there.\n",

    "- The `try` block contains code that might raise an exception (in this case, a `ZeroDivisionError` due to dividing by zero).\n",
    "- The `except` block catches the `ZeroDivisionError` and prints an error message.\n",
    "- The second `except` block is a generic exception handler that catches any exception (represented by `Exception`) and prints an error message.\n",
